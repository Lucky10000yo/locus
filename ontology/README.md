# Ontology
The sets.nt file is an RDF knowledge graph encoded with the N-Triples file format. It should be viewed with Protege. Currently it contains only the set theoretic hierarchy of classes used in Locus. The topos theoretic ontology, the main goal of this project, is still a work in progress.

## Set theoretic ontology
The set theoretic ontology is a hierarchy of set systems which are the main objects of set theory. This is based upon classical logic rather then categorical logic, so it remains to construct a newer ontology.

Set systems are classified using concepts from a wide range of sources like graph theory, topology, order theory, lattice theory, hypergraph theory, incidence structures, and so on. The combination of concepts from a wide range of sources lead to our creation of an ontology containing hundreds of different classes of set systems.

## Topos theoretic ontology
The fundamental organizing principle of the Locus project is the utility of modeling entities as presheaves. Consequently, the top level concept of our upper ontology might be a 'structured presheaf', which is a broad concept entailing any number of things to do with presheaf theory.

As sets are modeled as presheaves over the topos with a single point, a structured set is a structured presheaf. This then naturally includes all kinds of algebraic structures modeled as structured sets. Categories are structured quivers, which makes them structured presheaves as well. Functions are special types of presheaves.

Structure sheaves such as as schemes are structured presheaves. They have an underlying presheaf defined by removing the structure produced by the elements of the sheaf. This defines how the topos theoretic ontology of presheaves will be related to algebraic geometry. Classical varieties are simply modeled as sets of points in some geometric space.

The best theory of mathematical structure is provided by presheaf topoi. This still leaves open the question of entities of a less structural nature, such as elements of structures. To resolve this we may have to build a dualistic ontology also containing contextual elements. Contextual elements will describe aspects of structures rather then structures themselves. This ontology then can be extended in a wide variety of ways while keeping true to topoi as foundations.
