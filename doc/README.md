# Documentation
The documentation for the Locus project is currently divided up into two components: the user manual and the references list.

## User manual
The user manual is the main source of information on the features in Locus. It contains a basic overview of the topos theoretic philosophy of Locus, and the various elementary topoi and grothendieck topoi currently implemented by the system.

## References
This is a basic list of the various graduate level math texts used to provide inspiration for the features in Locus.
