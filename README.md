# Locus
A computer algebra system based upon presheaf theory.

## The geometry of memory
Locus is based upon the idea that we can reason logically about the geometry of memory using topos theory.

* Memory locations: congruences in the topos Sets
* Data dependencies: congruences in the topos Sets^(->)

Memory locations and data dependencies are presheaf congruences. This motivates our idea that computation should be modeled using presheaf theory.

## Visualisation of presheaves
A typical presheaf over a partial order can be displayed using Graphviz clusters. Each cluster of nodes represents a set of the copresheaf and the arrows between them represent generating functions. These generalize the box and arrow diagrams typically used for displaying functions.

Copresheaves in the topos Sets^(1,2) are used in the topos theory of hypegraphs. Any hypergraph or finite set system produces a corresponding span copresheaf.

This method of visualisation works best for copresheaves over partial orders. Otherwise, a JavaFX based graphical user interface is provided to handle the visualisation of copresheaves over finitely generated categories. It displays an interactive quiver that opens up a set or function diagram when you click on its objects or morphisms.

The same technique used in the copresheaf viewer can be used to view globular sets, which associate arbitrary quivers to the hom classes in a directed graph, instead of functions. So alternative mechanisms of visualisations are available for globular sets, which are another important class of presheaf encountered in topos theory.

## Features
Locus is based upon the idea of organizing mathematical theories using presheaf theory. Locus enables computations in presheaf theory.

A user manual is provided in the documentation folder. It describes our original research into the topos theoretic foundations of computation and their implementation. A revised and updated version of the user manual will be developed soon.
